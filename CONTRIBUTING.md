# Contributing Guidelines for Students

​This document lists all the key points for contributing in our organization.

## How to start

The best way to get started is to connect with us on our [Open source discord server](https://discord.gg/Je2qvjCKxx). Join the channel of the project you're interested in and introduce yourself.
You can begin with looking for good first issues in the repo and ask to be assigned to it.

1. Don't start working on an issue unless you're assigned to it, someone else might be already working on it.
2. Open a draft PR within a week of being assigned to the issue, or let the maintainers know when you're stuck. Inactivity for over a week might lead to being unassigned from the issue so that it is open for other contributors.

## How to write a proposal

Select an idea you would like to work on during your GSoC. You can go through the ideas proposed by our mentors listed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tHXozV1HGt8myVtN2ZUjXb-4AJZMIS6FyXqxBpvfd5o/view). You are also welcome to propose your own idea. However, make sure to discuss your idea with us before starting to work on the proposal.
It's important to gain clarity on the idea you're working on. Try to understand the deliverables of the project in depth and try to provide lots of details about how you would approach the project.
You can refer our [base template](base-template.md) to get an idea about how to go writing the proposal.
While proposing your expected timeline for the project, divide the project into several components and set up realistic goals for yourself.
It is always a good idea to keep your mentor in loop while writing the proposal. Your mentor can provide you with valuable feedback and suggest you better ways of achieving something that you might not have thought of.
Overall, your application should make us believe that you are capable of completing the project and delivering the functionality to our users.
Free free to contact us whenever you feel stuck. We will be more than happy to help you out :)
